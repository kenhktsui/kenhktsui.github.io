title: Low Latency CPU Based Educational Value Classifier With Generic Educational Value
description: The low latency classifier and fineweb-edu-fasttext-classifier present a promising way to 1) filter dataset in a cheap and scalable way and 2) evaluating pretraining dataset at scale, before pretraining, that will help researchers and practitioners with less compute resources to train large/ small language model in a more efficient way.
