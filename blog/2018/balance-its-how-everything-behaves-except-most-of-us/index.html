It may be coincident but it can’t be randomly formed.</p> <p>Weather is the balance of day and night, rain and drought, high and low, which forms fountain and sea to nurture lives.</p> <p>Our body is about regulation of energy and chemical and therefore a lot of biological systems have negative feedback mechanism to balance all sort of things.</p> <p>Law is the balance of defining too much and defining too little. Defining too much will lose the generality, defining too little will open loophole.</p> <p>Writing or composing is about the balance of structures, particularly in poem or classical music. And so is the story flow, which need to have a right balance of prelude and climax.</p> <p>Microeconomics is about the balance of demand and supply with the help of price adjustment; and macroeconomics is about the balance of economic growth, inflation, interest rate, etc.</p> <p>Stock market and property price can’t go up forever, it has to plummet eventually if it is not in its equilibrium. And it has to rebound if it is too low. It’s ultimately subject to balance.</p> <p>Machine learning is about the balance of overfitting and under-fitting, and about the balance of exploration and exploitation.</p> <p><strong>Balance is the key to achieve stability which can stand against the test of time and disruption. There is nothing which could stand still without balance in itself. It does not work in isolation but seamlessly integrates in a larger ecosystem as if it was invisible.</strong></p> <p>Before we learned to walk, we had learned balancing ourselves. It is the idea we had learned long time ago and practised physically everyday but might have forgotten it mentally.</p> <p>Have we balanced ourselves? Are we too busy earning a living without knowing our conscience? <strong>We were born with no desire, except the biological needs. If our desire is a disrupting force to our balance, what is then the rebalancing force?</strong></p> <p>It might be a state of mind that we desire nothing. <strong>We are taught to get, perform and achieve, but we are not taught to stop and get nothing</strong>. When we desire nothing, we will not favour one to another; we will not be influenced by emotion; we are like a new-born baby who has no concept of knowledge but can rewire our brain to absorb knowledge unconsciously like a sponge. It is a perspective that we might have never explored.</p> <p><strong>It is not pessimistic. It’s just how every single thing behaves. Everything stays in its balance without leaving it and together forms an eco-system that we can’t notice. It exists in the past, the present and the future. It’s one the principles behind the universe we should learn and perhaps imitate.</strong></p> <p>Meditate and be selfless, give yourselves 10min to observe your balance and imbalance.</p> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/621/1*htzkm_sDeVflOIly34elRQ@2x.jpeg"></figure> <p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=aa3ad0ab8a26" width="1" height="1" alt=""></p> </body></html>
